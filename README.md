A game I'm working on.  Mostly just for fun, but also to learn how to program in Go.  

My version for the game is sort of a cross between Simcity and Civilization- you're building an old fashioned city with basic resources instead of money, but everything has to be transported to the specific location where it will be used, so there will be a complicated transportation network for everything.  Right now it doesn't do much except change some values and print them out.
